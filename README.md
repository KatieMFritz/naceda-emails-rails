## What is this site?
This is a web application designed for NACEDA, the National Alliance of Community Economic Development Associations, by Katie Fritz.

It's meant to make it easy to create fancy HTML emails using predesigned templates.

## I'm from NACEDA. What do I do?
1. Pick your template from the "Create a new email" menu above.
2. Type or paste your content into the appropriate boxes. Use H3 for headlines within boxes.
3. Click Save & View.
4. If you need to make changes, go back to the form. You can click the link above the email preview, find your email in Saved Emails, or bookmark the edit or view page.
5. When you're good to go, click the Copy to Clipboard button on the View page.
6. Paste the code into MemberClicks and follow the rest of the instructions for sending email.

## Why do I have to log in?
Only NACEDA staff should be able to make changes to emails, so a login is required. Everyone uses the same login.

If you forget how to log in, contact Katie.

## What should I do if I have a problem?
Save your work, then contact Katie. Please specify what email you are having trouble with and what you are trying to do.

If you just need a little tiny change, you might be able to make it in the code once you paste it into MemberClicks.

## I'm not from NACEDA. Can I get a version of this?
Sure, I'd be happy to talk with you about adapting this app to your needs. Contact me at katie@katiemfritz.com.

If you're a developer, you can fork the code at https://github.com/KatieMFritz/naceda-email-rails.
